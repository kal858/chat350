# chat350
A realtime chat application built using AngularJS and Go

# Technologies used
* AngularJS
* Go
* WebSockets API

## AngularJS
This framework was used in order to make use of real time two way data binding.

## Go
Go is a fun way to write server side code. It reduces the amount of boilerplate
that you have to write, but is also extensible and scalable. I chose to use Go
in order to get more experience using it to write applications.

## WebSockets API
The standard HTTP protocol provides a stateless half-duplex connection. The 
WebSockets API on the other hand creates a full duplex connection between the 
server and the client which can make it more responsive than traditional
HTTP in real time applications.

_calicoJake_ provided some useful starting material which I was inspired by so
I continued to develop upon his basic starting application.
